# Merkle-Hash-Tree

How to use the program:
In order to properly run the program, add text files to the folder titled 'files'.
The program will get the names of these files in this folder, then it will read them in the base folder.
Copy the files from 'files' to the project folder where .c and .h files are held.
Run the program and top hash will be computed.
